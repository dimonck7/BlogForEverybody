History of "Blog For Everybody"
------------

I had the idea to make a blog just not like other blogs.

In this blog you can:

Post anything!

About anything!

And read anyone!

The name of this project is "Blog For Everyone"

Of course, it presents "some regular blog content", which is necessarily involved in all blog platforms around the web and is simply understandable and easy to use!

Post writing, editing your profile and your personal page, ability to follow and unfollow other users. After you follow some bloggers, their new posts go to the main page where you can see them. Do not worry, your blog page will be filled with your own posts, no one else's!

Additional functions: 
You can have a free translation of all posts (so far only english). 
Set up and create your blog page as you wish. Choose an avatar and customize it! 
After you become someones follower, you can optionally receive all information about this blogger, which sends on your email. Finally, log in with OpenID(Google,AOL,Livejornal and other adds).

Try it!
I don't know exactly how long the application will be available on this address, but nothing prevents you to check whether or not it is available! â€”--> [Here](http://blog-for-everybody.herokuapp.com) we go!
